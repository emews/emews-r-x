= emews-r-x

A simple Anaconda package with unmodified R from SVN for use with EMEWS.

Only necessary for platform `osx-arm64`, due to a memory error in the official Anaconda release.  Still a problem as of 2024-12-12.

== Notes

Remember to:
. Update PLATFORM
.. in conda-build.sh
.. in meta.yaml
. Update `meta.yaml:source:path:`
. Install xcrun

=== For SSH

. Use `ssh -X`
. Set `ForwardX11Trusted yes`
